#     hint: Message of the hint. Optionally, it is possible to use '{}' at the place where the matched group from 're' should be inserted. This requires 'match_to_output: True'.
#     match_to_output: (False by default) see the description of 'hint'.


# Rules to write regex for hints on how to resolve errors
# - Do not use more than one whitespace in a row. The script automatically merges several whitespaces into one when capturing output
# - Do not use \n in your regex. They are all automatically deletes by the script when capturing output
